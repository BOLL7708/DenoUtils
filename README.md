# DenoUtils
Bespoke generic classes written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) to be used with [Deno](https://deno.com).

These are mainly used for my own personal projects, feel free to look at this as reference material, anything in here can change at any time as I adapt things to my own needs.
